This is a small repository that investigates how easy it is to detect cheating
in marathons.

The initial dataset that has been collected was scraped from the [2023 Chicago
Marathon](https://results.chicagomarathon.com/2023) in which Kelvin Kiptum ran
the current world record marathon time of `02:00:30` and Siffan Hassan ran the
Second fastest recorded time for women.
